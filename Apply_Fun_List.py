# Create a List
regimentNames = ['Night Riflemen', 'Jungle Scouts', 'The Dragoons', 'Midnight Revengence', 'Wily Warriors']

# For loop that goes through list and capitalise
regimentNamesCapitalized = []
for i in regimentNames:
    regimentNamesCapitalized.append(i.upper())

# Print the list of Capitalized
print(regimentNamesCapitalized)
